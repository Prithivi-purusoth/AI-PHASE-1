# ai-phase1# Market Basket Analysis - Phase 1

## Overview

Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a powerful technique used by retailers to uncover associations between products that customers tend to buy together. By understanding these patterns, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies, improve sales, and enhance customer experience. This repository represents Phase 1 of the Market Basket Analysis project, detailing the initial steps and processes involved in analyzing customer purchase data.

## Project Description

In this phase, the focus is on data collection, cleaning, and initial exploration. The primary objectives include:

- **Data Collection**: Gather raw transaction data from the retail store. This data includes information about customer purchases, such as product IDs, quantities, and timestamps.

- **Data Cleaning**: Process the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies. Clean data is crucial for accurate analysis and pattern recognition.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform preliminary analysis to understand the basic statistics, trends, and patterns in the data. EDA helps in formulating hypotheses for the subsequent phases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python (version 3.6 and above)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive data exploration)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-basket-analysis-phase1.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd market-basket-analysis-phase1
```

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Place the raw transaction data files (in CSV or Excel format) in the `data/raw` directory.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Run the data cleaning scripts to process the raw data:

   ```bash
   python data_cleaning.py
   ```

   This script will clean the data and save the cleaned dataset in the `data/processed` directory.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE to run the EDA scripts:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb
   ```

   Explore the dataset, visualize trends, and identify patterns among products and customer behaviors.
